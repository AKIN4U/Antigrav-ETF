1) Positioning and clarity gaps
    • The site reads as a scholarship / education trust fund portal (ETF) rather than ETF bursary enrolment and registration platform. Since bursary is the core product we planning to provide for the students, Lets make that explicit in the hero copy and “Apply” page so users don’t second-guess what they’re signing up for. 
    • Add a clear “How it works” section on the Apply page with:
        ◦ who can apply
        ◦ what you fund (tuition only? transport? books?)
        ◦ what you don’t fund
        ◦ expected timelines (review window, interview dates, disbursement date)
        ◦ Feedback or Comments field where by they can provide other information for us the review to note any missing or additional information by the candidate.
2) Missing policy and compliance essentials (high priority)
    • Your footer links to Privacy Policy and Terms of Service but both return 404 Not Found. That’s a credibility hit and a legal risk. 
    • Add, at minimum:
        ◦ Privacy Policy 
        ◦ Terms of Use
        ◦ Document retention policy (how long you keep IDs/school invoices and Candidate credentials).  (GDPR requires 7 years for retention of personal data)
        ◦ Applicants consent checkbox (data processing + sharing with committee/school for verification)
        ◦ Safeguarding note if applicants are minors (parent/guardian consent + handling children’s data). i.e. a session for candidate below the age of 18 ages. 
3) Application flow: what’s missing for a real review process
You have a strong multi-step form structure (Personal, Academic, Family, Documents, Review). What you still need around it:
Applicant side
    • Application status tracking: Draft → Submitted → Under Review → Shortlisted → Verified → Approved/Rejected → Disbursed
    • Email/SMS notifications for key status changes
    • Ability to edit resubmit if “Returned for correction”
    • A checklist on the Documents step:
        ◦ required vs optional docs
        ◦ accepted file types (PDF/JPG/PNG)
        ◦ file size limit
        ◦ document quality guidance (clear photo, full page, not cropped)
    • A “support ticket / help” option inside the dashboard (not only a generic email)
Committee side (admin portal)
    • A real review workflow definition:
        ◦ triage queue (new submissions)
        ◦ scoring rubric (need, academic performance, church membership verification, one-child policy check)
        ◦ comment log and “request additional info”
        ◦ final decision capture + reason categories (useful for reporting and fairness)
    • Audit trail: who reviewed, who changed a status, when, and what changed
    • Export for reporting (CSV/PDF) and donor/church reporting
4) Identity, eligibility, and anti-fraud controls
Right now registration is email + password. For bursary selection and document upload, you’ll want:
    • Email verification on sign-up
    • Strong password policy + rate limiting + lockout
    • CAPTCHA on register/login/forgot password/ Passkey to reduce abuse
    • Duplicate detection: same child, same parent/guardian, same phone number, same school ID
    • “One child per family” enforcement mechanics (you state the policy, but you also need the platform logic to support it). 
    • Clear eligibility evidence fields (member ID, parish/unit, guardian details, proof of indigence criteria)
5) Security and data protection basics (technical)
Given we’re collecting sensitive documents:
    • Encryption in transit (HTTPS) is assumed, but also plan for encryption at rest for uploaded files
    • Private storage for documents (no public bucket URLs)
    • Virus/malware scanning on upload
    • Role-based access control (committee members only see what they must)
    • Session security (short-lived tokens, secure cookies)
    • Backups + disaster recovery plan (especially during application peaks)
6) UX details that will reduce drop-offs
    • Add an “Application requirements” box directly on the form page, not only on the Apply info page (people skip reading). 
    • Add autosave confirmation (“Saved 2 mins ago”) and a clear “Continue later” entry point from the dashboard
    • Show progress percentage and estimated time per step
    • Inline validation (date formats, age range, required fields) and human error messages
    • Mobile optimisation check: your main audience is likely mobile-first
7) Content that’s missing but applicants expect
    • FAQ page (eligibility, required docs, deadlines, how disbursement works)
    • Timeline / application window dates (open/close dates)
    • Appeals process (if rejected)
    • Contact options: phone/WhatsApp + office hours + physical office address (if applicable)
    • Transparency note: selection criteria summary and how decisions are made
8) Consistency and credibility checks
    • Donation page claims “Secured by Paystack • PCI-DSS Compliant”. Make sure that statement is accurate for your specific integration and only refers to Paystack’s card processing scope, not our whole platform. 
    • Add organisation registration details (church office address, trustees/committee, governance summary) to reduce “is this legit?” concerns.
    • Q&A / Suggestions / Feedbacks Sessions to receive information from external candidates


Checklist Update: 
Below is a tight build checklist for a bursary enrolment + student dashboard + committee review platform. It’s written stack-agnostic, with specific professional and technical recommendations.
